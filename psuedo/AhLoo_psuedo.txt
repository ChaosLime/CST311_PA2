# declare modules

<import socket stuff>

# declare and assign address of UDP IP

# declare and assign UDP port number

# create the client socket

# set timeout for server reply (1 sec)

# set sequence variable to track sequence count

# create list to store RTT values

# create while loop to repeat process

  # set current time, assign seq count to message variable

  # try and except block to handle exceptions

    # set client socket to receive message from serverSocket

    # calculate RTT

  # declare except condition to reply with timeout if no response in 1 second
  # increment seq count by 1
# end while

# create conditional to check sequence count more than 10

  # calculate loss rate and convert to string

  # calculate mean value

  # display max RTT, min, average RTT,
