#UDPPingerClient.py
#Nicholas Saunders Pseudo Code
#Create a module to send 10 pings and implement a timeout 
#Create a UDP socket for client 
#Input to be sent to server as a ping 
#Start a loop for 10 packets being sent 
	
	#Start time before sending packet 
	#Send packet 
	#Implementing a 1 sec timeout 
	#Set timeout with throw/expection on TimeoutError
	
	#Try/Exception block 
	try
		#Receive message back from server if it has been sent 
	except: 
		#If a timeout exception is thrown it will time out and the loop will move forward 
		#adjust appropriate values with increments 
	continue
	#Received message from the server we time RTT, add 
	#appropriate values into all, and set min/max when necessary 

	#average start-stop time as of this point is calculated and printed 
	#Now that we are out of the loop we will calculate total average and loss percentage 
	#Printing loss percentage, total average, min, and max 
	#close socket
